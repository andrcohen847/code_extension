# Ruby Code Extension

This is the ruby part of the code extension.

## Setup
1. Install ruby 2.5.0. We like to use rbenv, but do your thing, it's all good. (https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)

2. `gem install bundler`

3. `bundle install`

## Running the server

` rails s` will start a server on port 3000. You can then see the site at http://localhost:3000

## Running the tests

`bin/rspec` runs the test suite
