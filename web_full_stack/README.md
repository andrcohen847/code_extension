# Reverb Code Extension

This is a code extension designed so that we can code together during an on-site interview. Our guiding principal is: **we want to see you at your best** .

## Instructions

1. Choose which example (Ruby or React) you would like to extend. If you don't feel comfortable in either of those 2 examples, feel free to implement your own (see "Implementing Your Own Solution"). Again, _we want to see the best side of you_ so please make sure you are comfortable with what we will be working on.
2. If you bring your own computer to the interview, please ensure you are ready to go by having anything installed beforehand. If you want to use one of Reverb's computers, please tell us which code editor you prefer and which language you will be doing the extension in.
3. Familiarize yourself with the code (or write your own if you prefer) and make sure you understand how it works.
4. That's it! We'll give you all other information during the coding session.

## Words of Wisdom

1. Our implementations are not 100% complete or refactored in the best possible way. None of the code is gospel, so don't think you have to copy our style in any way. We're open to new ways of doing things as long as we can have a dialogue about it.

2. Our intention is not to trick you or test you; we want to collaborate. So if you have any questions about this, please reach out and ask!

### Implementing Your Own Solution
Again, _you do not need to do this_, but if Ruby / React aren't your jams, we don't want to force you into something you don't know. So, if you'd like to use another language / framework, we welcome that. In that case, please come to the office with code that solves the "Problem" stated below.

We provide an API for developers to create new experiences powered by Reverb. We'd like you to use this API to build a program with the following features:

- **Category Search** — Given a string, return all categories that contain that string. For example, a search for the category "Electric" would match "Electric Guitars", "Electric Pianos", etc. (Please use https://api.reverb.com/api/categories/flat and make sure you are setting the right headers https://www.reverb-api.com/docs/http-headers )
- **Show Listings** — Show the first 10 listings from our API ( https://api.reverb.com/api/listings/all )
