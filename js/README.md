JavaScript Code Extension
---
The JS Code Extension is a React application created using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Tests are written using [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) and [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) manages routing.

You'll need [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) installed and a recent version (>= 8) of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) to use this project. If you're using homebrew you can brew install both of those or if you want to manage multiple versions of node on your machine, we suggest using a tool like [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

# Setup
* `yarn install`

## Running/Tests
* `yarn run start` to start the development server.
* `yarn run test` to start the test suite.
