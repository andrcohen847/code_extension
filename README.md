# Reverb Code Extension

This is a code extension designed so that we can code together during an on-site interview. Our guiding principal is: *we want to see you at your best* .

Some things to note:

1. The extension solves "The Problem" stated below.

2. We have provided some starting points in some languages, but if you would rather use a different language or use something else, please do. Again, _we want to see the best side of you_ so please make sure you are comfortable with what we will be working on.

3. Our implementations are not 100% complete or refactored in the best possible way. None of the code is gospel, so don't think you have to copy our style in any way.

4. Our intention is not to trick you or test you; we want to collaborate. So if you have any questions about this, please reach out and ask!

## The Problem
We provide an API for developers to create new experiences powered by Reverb. We'd like you to use this API to build a program with the following features:

- *Category Search* — Given a string, return all categories that contain that string. For example, a search for the category "Electric" would match "Electric Guitars", "Electric Pianos", etc.
- *Show Listings* — Show the first 10 listings from our API
