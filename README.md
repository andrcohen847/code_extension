# Reverb Code Extension

These code extensions are designed so that we can code together during an on-site interview. Our guiding principal is: **we want to see you at your best** .

## Instructions

1. Choose the role you are interviewing for ( data / web ) and read the README there.
2. If you bring your own computer to the interview, please ensure you are ready to go by having anything installed beforehand. If you want to use one of Reverb's computers, please tell us which code editor you prefer and which language you will be doing the extension in.
3. Familiarize yourself with the problem or the code.
4. That's it! We'll give you all other information during the coding session.
